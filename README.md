AIM: Create Android Application to demonstrate Frame by frame animation and splash screen to demonstrate twin animation.

Describing: In this project, an Android app is developed to showcase two types of animations. The Splash Screen appears first, using tween animation (such as scaling, rotating, translating, and fading) to smoothly display the app logo before moving to the main screen. The Main Activity demonstrates frame-by-frame animation using an ImageView and AnimationDrawable, where multiple drawable images are displayed one after another to create a motion effect.
